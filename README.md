Here's an example of how you can describe a chess game between two players, M and N, in the README file:

Chess Game - 2 Player Match: M vs N
Game Overview
This game is a two-player chess match between Player M (White) and Player N (Black). The match follows the standard rules of chess, with each player aiming to checkmate the opponent’s king. The game starts with both players controlling a set of 16 pieces and takes place on an 8x8 chessboard. Each player takes turns moving their pieces, and the game ends when one player's king is checkmated, or if the game results in a stalemate or draw.

Players
Player M (White): The first player to move, controlling the white pieces.
Player N (Black): The second player, controlling the black pieces.
Chess Setup
The pieces are initially set up in the following order on the chessboard:

Row 1 (for Player M - White): Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook
Row 2 (for Player M - White): 8 Pawns
Row 8 (for Player N - Black): Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook
Row 7 (for Player N - Black): 8 Pawns
Each player will move their pieces according to the rules of chess, striving to outmaneuver the other, control key squares, and ultimately deliver checkmate.

Game Phases
Opening
Player M (White) starts the game with the first move. Player M may choose a variety of openings, such as moving a pawn to e4 or d4, or developing a knight to f3 or c3.
Player N (Black) responds to Player M's opening move. Player N might choose a defense like the Sicilian Defense (moving pawn to c5), the French Defense (moving pawn to e6), or others.
Midgame
As the game progresses, both players develop their pieces, ensuring control over the center of the board.
Player M (White) attempts to create weaknesses in Player N's (Black's) position, perhaps by attacking pawns or placing pieces in threatening positions.
Player N (Black) responds, defending key squares and countering Player M's attacks.
Endgame
As the number of pieces on the board decreases, both players maneuver their remaining pieces toward the opponent's king, attempting to create a checkmate scenario.
Player M may attempt to use their queen and rooks for a final assault on Player N’s king, while Player N (Black) may try to hold off the attack and seek counterplay.
Game Conclusion
Checkmate: In this game, the outcome was decided when Player M (White) successfully delivered checkmate to Player N’s (Black's) king. This occurred after a series of tactical maneuvers, forcing Player N's king into a position with no escape.

Stalemate or Draw: If at any point, neither player could force a checkmate or one of the players runs out of legal moves while not being in check, a stalemate or draw would occur, resulting in a tie.
